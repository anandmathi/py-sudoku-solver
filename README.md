# py-sudoku-solver: Sudoku Solver

An application that allows you to input any valid Sudoku board and visualize the solution process using backtracking. Includes a functional settings menu that allows you to enable/disable the visualizer, set the visualizer speed, and apply one of various heuristics/modifications (forward checking, minimum remaining values, hill climbing, random restart).

Created using PySimpleGUI.
